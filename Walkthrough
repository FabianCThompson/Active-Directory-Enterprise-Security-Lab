Domain: Identity & Access Management

Objective: Master Active Directory (AD) to manage users, groups, policies, and security configuration in a Windows enterprise environment.

Key Outcomes:

Create Organizational Units (OUs) and user accounts.
Configure domain-level and OU-level Group Policies.
Enforce security policies (password complexity, access control
Lab Setup

Topology:

Windows Server: 192.168.1.10

Domain: campus.edu


Tools used:

Active Directory Users & Computers (dsa.msc)
Group Policy Management Console
Command Prompt (net user, gpupdate)
Lab Tasks

Task 1: Create Organizational Units & User Accounts
Open Active Directory Users and Computers via dsa.msc.

Right-click domain (campus.edu) → New → Organizational Unit.
Name: Minecraft (example OU).


Create users inside Minecraft OU:
Right-click OU → New → User.
Usernames: creeper, zombie, steve.
Password: P@ssw0rd (uncheck "User must change password at next logon")




Why This Matters:

Organizational Units mirror organizational structure (e.g., Finance, IT). Policies applied to an Organizational Unit affect all contained objects.

Task 2: Configure domain-level and OU-level Group Policies
Task 2: Set Domain-Level Password Policy
Open Group Policy Management → Expand Forest: campus.edu → Domains → campus.edu.

Edit Default Domain Policy.

Navigate to:Computer Configuration → Policies → Security Settings → Account Policies → Password Policy.

Set Minimum password length to 10 characters



Now we need to refresh the group policy in the Command Prompt


Security Impact:

Domain-level policies enforce baseline security (e.g., password complexity) across all users.
